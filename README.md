## Code Review
- Injected my hamburger menu code into my landing page  andbroke everything, though mostly just the CSS.
- Managed to get it to work almost properly by brute forcing through the CSS structure.
- No idea why the menu "travels" down the page if you scroll down while the menu is open.
